# Pandemic Notifier ðŸš¨

Pandemic Notifier is an app that notifies the user if he was near a person with the coronavirus. This app was made by Omar Gamal for the ISEF competition. 

## How it works ðŸ“±

The app uses Bluetooth to scan for nearby devices that have the app installed. If a user reports that they have tested positive for the coronavirus, the app will send an alert to all the devices that were in contact with them in the past 14 days. The app also provides information on how to get tested and what to do if you have symptoms.

## Why it matters ðŸŒŽ

The coronavirus pandemic has affected millions of people around the world. By using this app, you can help reduce the spread of the virus and protect yourself and others. The app is designed to respect your privacy and does not collect or share any personal data.
